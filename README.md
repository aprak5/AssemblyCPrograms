# Assembly/C Programs

## Overview

The purpose of these programs was to familiarize myself with different aspects of Assembly, C, and lower-level programming. To run all programs in this repository, make sure the latest version of Docker is installed. To see more details, visit the README.md/comments for each individual program/folder above.
